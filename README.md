# Jenga Construction Project Management System

Objective: To develop a web-based platform that enables real-time tracking and management of ongoing construction projects, focusing on daily tasks, materials on-site, and labor workforce.

# Project Overview

Jenga Build is an intuitive, front-end construction project management system designed to streamline daily operations on construction sites. The platform provides an efficient way to log daily tasks, monitor material usage, and track labor attendance using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JSON.

# Key Features

1. Project Dashboard
   Displays ongoing construction projects with real-time status updates.
   Provides an overview of daily logs, including materials received, tasks completed, and labor attendance.
   Supports JSON-based data storage for seamless updates without requiring a backend.
2. Daily Task Tracker
   Lists current tasks being implemented (e.g., excavation, foundation, roofing).
   Allows project managers to update progress dynamically from JSON files.
   Tracks task completion status (Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed).
3. Materials Inventory Management
   Logs materials received, used, and remaining for each project.
   Issues low-stock alerts when material quantities fall below a set threshold.
   Provides real-time updates for site managers to track material flow effectively.
4. Labor Workforce Tracking
   Tracks daily labor numbers, categorized by role (e.g., Masons, Carpenters, Electricians).
   Stores attendance records in JSON, ensuring transparency in workforce management.
   Offers insights into daily labor allocation and work efficiency.
